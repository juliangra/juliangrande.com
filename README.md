# My Personal Homepage - ðŸ‘‹

A *(very)* small little website listing some of my working experience 
and some contact details. Made primarily to explore Nuxt and it's features

### ðŸ”¨ Technologies
Developed using Nuxt with:
- Nuxt v3
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- `nuxt-icon`
- `nuxt-content` for markdown rendering
